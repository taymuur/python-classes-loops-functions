# python-classes-loops-functions

The notebooks cover the basic python concepts that are crucial for logic building and code development. This was compiled during my initial stages of learning python from several courses at once. The concepts covered are:
1) Loops (while and for)
2) Classes (object-oriented programming)
3) Functions (code reusability)
4) String formatting
